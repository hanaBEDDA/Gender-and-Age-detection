# Gender and Age detection

# Introduction
Age and gender detection that happens automatically has become more and more useful in various applications, especially because of the popularity of social media. However, the current methods for doing this with regular pictures don't work as well as they should. This is in contrast to the big improvements we've seen in recognizing faces. In my project, I used a type of computer program called a deep convolutional neural network to improve how well we can do age and gender recognition. I designed a simpler version of this program that can still do a good job, even if there isn't a lot of data to learn from. I tested my program using a dataset called UTKFace to estimate people's ages, races, and genders, and it did a lot better than the best methods we have right now.

# About the Dataset
The UTKFace dataset is a valuable resource for various computer vision and machine learning projects. Here are some additional details to include in your project:

1. **Data Size:** The dataset is extensive, containing over 20,000 face images. This large sample size can be advantageous for training and evaluating your models effectively.

2. **Age Range:** The dataset covers a wide age range, from newborns to individuals as old as 116 years. This diversity allows for comprehensive age-related research and applications.

3. **Annotations:** Each image in the UTKFace dataset is annotated with three key attributes - age, gender, and ethnicity. These annotations are essential for supervised learning tasks, such as age estimation, gender classification, and ethnicity recognition.

4. **Variability:** The dataset showcases substantial variability in terms of pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, and other factors. This diversity mirrors real-world conditions and can be instrumental in building robust models.

5. **Use Cases:** The UTKFace dataset is versatile and can be applied to various computer vision tasks, including but not limited to:
   - Face detection: Identifying the presence and location of faces in images.
   - Age estimation: Predicting the age of individuals based on their facial features.
   - Age progression/regression: Investigating how faces change with age or estimating future appearances.
   - Landmark localization: Locating specific facial landmarks like eyes, nose, and mouth.

6. **Training and Evaluation:** The dataset can serve as a reliable benchmark for your project, providing a standardized and comprehensive set of images for training and testing your models.

7. **Ethical Considerations:** When using the dataset, be mindful of ethical considerations related to privacy and bias, especially when working with attributes like ethnicity and age.
